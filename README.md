### Hooked Color Picker is a small React application where a user is able to dynamically change the background color of an element. 
### The background color is create in the HSL format and the corresponding value is rendered on the front-end for the user to see.
### The user is able to slide the H, S, and L values to alter the Hue, Saturation and Lighting of a color.
### The user is able to click a button in order to save the HSL color value to a list with the specific color as a background of that list item.
